# Detailed Guide

It's UI is a lightweight, accessible, component-driven UI library designed for legal and compliance applications. It provides a small set of reusable React components, a design token system for consistent theming, and Storybook-based documentation to accelerate building consistent user interfaces.

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Provide accessible, well-tested building blocks for legal workflows (forms, lists, dialogs, tokens, typography, colors).
- **Goals**: Accessibility-first, themeable, composable components that are small and easy to test and document.

## How the library is organized
- **src/**
  - **components/** — Individual React components (each component has its implementation, styles, tests, and Storybook story).
  - **styles/** — Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography), global variables and utility mixins.
  - **utils/** — Shared helpers (formatters, validators, aria helpers).
- **stories/** — Storybook stories and MDX pages documenting components and patterns.
- **docs/** — Higher-level documentation or examples (optional).
- **scripts/** — Build and publishing helpers.
- **package.json** — Build/test scripts and package metadata.

## Component architecture and conventions
- **Component structure**:
  - Each component folder contains:
    - `index.tsx` (exported component)
    - `ComponentName.tsx` (implementation)
    - `ComponentName.module.css` / `.scss` or styled file (styling)
    - `ComponentName.test.tsx` (unit tests)
    - `ComponentName.stories.tsx` / `.mdx` (Storybook)
- **Props and API**:
  - Keep props minimal and explicit.
  - Accept `className` and `style` to allow composition.
  - For complex behavior, expose controlled and uncontrolled variants (e.g., `value` / `defaultValue` + `onChange`).
- **Composition**:
  - Prefer small primitives (`Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `Dialog`, `List`).
  - Compose primitives into higher-level patterns in examples or application code.
- **Styling**:
  - Use the chosen strategy consistently (CSS Modules, CSS variables, or CSS-in-JS).
  - Design tokens are the single source of truth for colors, spacing, and typography.

## Design tokens and theming
- Tokens are defined in `src/styles` (JSON/TS/SCSS depending on the stack).
- **Token categories**:
  - colors: primary, surface, text, muted, error, success
  - spacing: base unit, scale (xs, sm, md, lg)
  - typography: font families, sizes, line heights
  - radii, shadows, z-indices
- **Usage**:
  - Components consume tokens via CSS custom properties or imported token values.
  - To theme, override the token layer (CSS variables on `:root`) or provide a `ThemeProvider` that maps tokens to CSS variables.
- **Example override (CSS variables)**:
  ```css
  :root {
    --la-primary: #0b5cff;
    --la-surface: #ffffff;
    --la-text: #111827;
  }
  ```

## Accessibility (how components are built)
- **Principles**:
  - Semantic HTML where possible (buttons, labels, lists).
  - Keyboard support for interactive components (Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys where applicable).
  - Proper ARIA roles and attributes for widgets (aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-invalid).
  - Focus management for overlays and dialogs (focus trap, initial focus, return focus on close).
  - Announce important changes to assistive tech (aria-live for toast/alerts).
- **Patterns**:
  - Inputs: associate label with input via `htmlFor/id`; provide `aria-describedby` for helper text and errors.
  - Dialogs: `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, and keyboard Esc to close.
  - Lists and menus: use `role="list"/"listitem"` or `role="menu"/"menuitem"` as appropriate and manage focus movement.

## Storybook and documentation
- Storybook is the single interactive source of truth for component behavior and examples.
- **Conventions**:
  - Every component has at least one story demonstrating basic usage.
  - Add edge-case stories (disabled, error states, long content).
  - Use Args to document props and enable interactive controls.
  - Use MDX for pattern pages that explain composition and tokens.
- **How to add a story**:
  - Create a `.stories.tsx` in the component folder.
  - Export a default with title and component.
  - Export story functions demonstrating usage and variants.

## Development workflow
- **Local dev**:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev` — start the component dev server (if applicable)
  - `npm run storybook` — run Storybook locally
- **Build**:
  - `npm run build` — build compiled package (ESM/CJS and type declarations). Output typically lands in `dist/` or `lib/`.
- **Tests**:
  - Unit tests with testing-library/react and Jest.
  - Aim for accessible behavior tests (keyboard, screen reader labels).
  - Snapshot only for stable presentational parts; prefer DOM assertions for behavior.
- **Lint and format**:
  - eslint for static checks
  - prettier for code formatting
  - `npm run lint` and `npm run format`

## Publishing
- **Versioning**: bump version field in `package.json`.
- Build artifacts must be generated before publishing: `npm run build`
- Publish: `npm publish --access public` (or your registry/pipeline)
- CI: configure pipeline to run tests/lint/build and publish on tagged releases.

## Example usage
- **Basic button**:
  ```tsx
  import { Button } from 'legal-aura-ui';

  function SaveButton() {
    return <Button onClick={() => save()}>Save</Button>;
  }
  ```
- **Input with validation**:
  ```tsx
  import { Input } from 'legal-aura-ui';
  // ... in component render
  <label htmlFor="case-number">Case number</label>
  <Input id="case-number" value={caseNumber} onChange={e => setCaseNumber(e.target.value)} />
  <small aria-live="polite">Use format: ABC-123</small>
  ```

## Testing patterns
- Prefer testing-library to assert user interactions, focus, keyboard navigation, and ARIA attributes.
- **Example assertions**:
  - `expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /save/i })).toBeEnabled()`
  - `fireEvent.keyDown(menu, { key: 'ArrowDown' })` and assert focus move

## Contributing
- Fork, create a feature branch, add tests and stories, run lint/format.
- Open PR with description, tests, storybook screenshots or links.
- Keep changes scoped and document any API changes.

## Troubleshooting & FAQs
- Styling not applying? Check token overrides and CSS variable scope.
- Accessibility issues? Run axe-core in Storybook or unit tests and fix semantic/ARIA usage.
- Build fails? Check TypeScript errors or missing exports in `index.ts`.

## Backend

This project primarily contains the UI library, but many applications using these components will also require a backend (server-side) layer. Below is a concise, practical summary you can copy into app repositories or use when planning integration between the UI and a server.

- Purpose: implement business rules, store and protect data, expose APIs for clients (web/mobile), integrate with third-party services, and provide observability and secure operations.

- Typical architecture components:
  - API / Web server (receives requests, enforces auth, runs business logic)
  - Databases (relational like Postgres for transactional data, or NoSQL for flexible schemas)
  - Cache (Redis) for hot reads and sessions
  - Message broker / queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS) for async work
  - Background workers for long-running or retryable tasks
  - Object storage (S3) for files and media
  - API gateway / load balancer for routing & rate-limiting
  - Monitoring & tracing (logs, metrics, distributed traces)

- API styles to consider:
  - REST + JSON: simple, well-supported, cacheable via HTTP
  - GraphQL: flexible queries, single endpoint, client-driven shapes
  - gRPC / Protobuf: high-performance, typed RPC for internal services

- Security & operations:
  - TLS everywhere, secure token-based auth (OAuth2/JWT), input validation, parameterized queries, secrets management, and least-privilege service accounts.
  - Add health/readiness endpoints, structured logs, metrics and traces early.

- Deployment & scalability:
  - Containerize (Docker) and deploy via Kubernetes, serverless, or managed platforms.
  - Use CI/CD for build/test/deploy and prefer canary or blue/green rollouts for safe releases.

- Minimal API contract (examples):
  - POST /api/v1/users — create user. Body: {email, password, name?}. Responses: 201 created or 409 conflict.
  - POST /api/v1/login — returns access/refresh tokens. 200 success, 401 invalid cred.
  - GET /api/v1/items?page&limit — list items, supports Authorization header.
  - POST /api/v1/orders — include idempotencyKey to prevent duplicate orders; 201 created or 409 duplicate.

If you want, I can add full example stacks (Node/Express, Python/FastAPI, Go) with a minimal OpenAPI contract and starter code for a backend that integrates with this UI.
